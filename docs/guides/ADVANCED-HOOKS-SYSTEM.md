# BUMBA Advanced Hooks System
## Transforming Claude Code into a Proactive, Learning Framework

### üèÅ Overview
The BUMBA Advanced Hooks System transforms Claude Code from a reactive tool into a proactive, learning framework that:
- **Learns from your workflow patterns** and optimizes suggestions
- **Automatically syncs context** between design tools and development environments
- **Predicts quality issues** before they occur
- **Optimizes MCP server performance** based on usage patterns
- **Provides intelligent command routing** based on intent analysis

## üèÅ Hook Lifecycle & Architecture

### Start Hooks (Initialization)
**Triggered**: When Claude Code session begins

1. **Context Bridge Sync** (`context-bridge.sh sync`)
   - Detects Figma connection status
   - Extracts design tokens from project
   - Maps components between design and code
   - Analyzes technology stack

2. **MCP Optimization Analysis** (`mcp-optimization-engine.sh analyze`)
   - Checks server performance metrics
   - Identifies slow or unreliable servers
   - Suggests optimization strategies

### Pre-Tool Use Hooks (Before Every Command)
**Triggered**: Before any tool execution

1. **Security & Quality Pre-scan** (`bumba-pre-execution.sh`)
   - Scans for security vulnerabilities

   - Tracks design-to-code workflows
   - Monitors Figma integration usage
   - Optimizes designer handoff processes

### Stop Hooks (Session End)
**Triggered**: When Claude Code session ends

1. **Completion Notification** (`bumba-completion.sh`)
   - Plays success sound
   - Logs session summary

2. **Project Context Synthesis** (`project-context-synthesis.sh`)
   - Generates intelligent project documentation
   - Creates context summaries
   - Updates project memory

3. **Learning Suggestions** (`workflow-learning-engine.sh suggest`)
