## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Command not found" Error
```bash
# Symptom: /bumba: commands not recognized
# Cause: Shell not updated or installation incomplete

# Solutions:
1. Reload shell configuration
   source ~/.bashrc   # For Bash
   source ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh

2. Restart terminal application completely

3. Verify Claude Code restart
   # Close and reopen Claude Code application

4. Check installation integrity
   /bumba:status      # Should show system status
```

#### "Permission denied" Error
```bash
# Symptom: Cannot install or access framework files
# Cause: Insufficient permissions for global installation

# Solutions:
1. Use sudo for global installation
   sudo npm install -g bumba-claude

2. Fix npm permissions (preferred)
   npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
   export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH

3. Use local installation instead
   npx bumba-claude@latest
```

#### "Claude directory not found" Error
```bash
# Symptom: Installation cannot find ~/.claude directory
# Cause: Claude Code not properly installed or configured

# Solutions:
1. Verify Claude Code installation
   # Download from https://claude.ai/code

2. Create Claude directory manually
   mkdir -p ~/.claude

3. Run Claude Code once to initialize
   # Open Claude Code and run any command

4. Force installation with directory creation
   bumba-claude --force-init
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Commands Not Working
```bash
# Symptom: BUMBA commands execute but don't work properly
# Diagnosis Steps:

1. Check framework status
   /bumba:status

2. Verify hook system integrity
   ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/
   # Should show executable hook files

3. Test individual components
   /bumba:help        # Should show help
   /bumba:menu        # Should show command list

# Solutions:
1. Reinstall framework
   npx bumba-claude@latest --force

2. Reset configuration
   rm ~/.claude/settings.json
   bumba-claude

3. Check for conflicts
   /bumba:settings diagnose
```

#### MCP Server Issues
```bash
# Symptom: MCP-dependent commands failing
# Diagnosis:

1. Check server status
   /bumba:status mcp-servers

2. Verify API key configuration
   echo $REF_API_KEY
   echo $SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN

3. Test individual servers
   /bumba:docs test query      # Test Ref MCP
   /bumba:scan test file       # Test Semgrep MCP

# Solutions:
1. Reconfigure API keys
   export REF_API_KEY="your_key"
   /bumba:settings update-keys

2. Restart Claude Code after configuration
   # MCP servers need restart to reload

3. Use fallback commands
   /bumba:research [topic]     # Uses web search fallback
```

#### Agent Coordination Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Agents not collaborating properly
# Diagnosis:

1. Check agent routing
   /bumba:team status

2. Verify memory system
   /bumba:status memory

3. Test handoff mechanisms
   /bumba:implement-agents test feature

# Solutions:
1. Clear and rebuild context
   /bumba:settings reset-context

2. Restart multi-agent session
   /bumba:team restart

3. Use explicit agent targeting
   /bumba:implement-strategy [task]  # Force Product-Strategist
   /bumba:implement-design [task]    # Force Design-Engineer
   /bumba:implement-technical [task] # Force Backend-Engineer
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Command Execution
```bash
# Symptom: Commands take longer than expected
# Optimization Steps:

1. Use token-efficient commands
   /bumba:docs [query]        # 60-95% fewer tokens than Context7
   
2. Optimize MCP server priority
   /bumba:settings mcp-priority

3. Clear unnecessary context
   /bumba:settings clear-cache

4. Use targeted commands
   /bumba:implement-design [task]  # Direct agent routing
   # Instead of /bumba:implement [task]  # Auto-routing overhead
```

#### Memory and Context Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Context loss or memory problems
# Solutions:

1. Enable memory MCP server
   /bumba:settings enable-memory

2. Use context preservation commands
   /bumba:checkpoint [description]   # Save current context

3. Manage context size
   /bumba:settings context-size auto

4. Use distributed context
   /bumba:team context-sync
```

### Quality Gate Failures

#### Security Scanning Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Security gates failing or blocking development
# Diagnosis:

1. Review security scan results
   /bumba:scan --verbose

2. Check security policy configuration
   /bumba:settings security-policy

# Solutions:
1. Address security vulnerabilities
   /bumba:secure [specific-issue]

2. Adjust security sensitivity
   /bumba:settings security-level moderate

3. Use security override (carefully)
   /bumba:implement --skip-security-gate
```

#### Code Quality Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Quality gates preventing command completion
# Solutions:

1. Review quality issues
   /bumba:status quality

2. Auto-fix common issues
   /bumba:improve code-quality

## 🏁 Framework Philosophy

### Consciousness-Driven Development

BUMBA embodies a revolutionary approach to software development that integrates **conscious intention** into every aspect of the development process. This philosophy, rooted in Rastafarian wisdom and sustainable practices, transforms coding from mere task execution into **purposeful creation**.

#### Core Principles
- **Conscious Intention**: Every line of code written with deliberate purpose and awareness
- **Collaborative Harmony**: Three agents working in perfect synchronization, like a jazz ensemble
- **Sustainable Practices**: Long-term thinking that considers environmental and social impact
- **Community-Centered**: Development that serves the broader community and promotes sharing
- **Quality as Sacred Practice**: Excellence not as requirement, but as spiritual discipline

#### Sacred Audio Ceremonies
The framework celebrates achievements through **sacred bumba-horn.mp3 ceremonies**, marking important milestones with conscious recognition of accomplishment. These moments of celebration reinforce the spiritual dimension of development work.

### The BUMBA Advantage
