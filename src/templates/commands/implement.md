**Professional Feature Development with Quality Enforcement**

## Mission

Professional feature development combining intelligent orchestration with mandatory quality gates and security validation for production-ready implementations.

## Phase 1: Intelligent Assessment

```bash
# Automatic complexity scoring and resource allocation
COMPLEXITY_SCORE=$(analyze_feature_complexity "$ARGUMENTS$")
ORCHESTRATION_APPROACH=$(determine_orchestration_strategy $COMPLEXITY_SCORE)
QUALITY_GATES=$(configure_quality_requirements $COMPLEXITY_SCORE)

memory store-requirement: "$ARGUMENTS$"
memory store-complexity: $COMPLEXITY_SCORE
memory store-approach: $ORCHESTRATION_APPROACH
```

## Phase 2: Security & Architecture Analysis

**Parallel agent coordination for comprehensive analysis:**

- **Agent 1**: Architecture patterns and design validation
- **Agent 2**: Security threat modeling and risk assessment
- **Agent 3**: Quality requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Agent 4**: Integration impact and dependency analysis

**Security Pre-validation**: All inputs scanned for vulnerabilities before implementation

## Phase 3: Quality-Enforced Implementation

- **Pre-execution**: Security scanning and input validation
- **During execution**: Real-time quality monitoring via qlty integration
- **Post-execution**: Comprehensive validation and optimization
- **Memory storage**: Context preservation for future reference

## Phase 4: Validation & Documentation

- **Functionality**: End-to-end testing and validation
- **Security**: Threat model validation and penetration testing
- **Performance**: Bottleneck analysis and optimization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation documentation

## Examples

```bash
/bumba:implement user authentication system with JWT
/bumba:implement responsive dashboard with real-time data
/bumba:implement REST API with rate limiting and caching
/bumba:implement chat system with WebSocket connections
```

**Success Criteria**: Feature implemented with zero security vulnerabilities, passing all quality gates, comprehensive testing, and professional documentation.
